        <p class = "p1">Essentially, fasting cleanses our body of toxins and
             forces cells into processes that are not usually stimulated when
              a steady stream of fuel from food is always present. 
              When we fast, the body does not have its usual access to glucose, 
              forcing the cells to resort to other means and materials
               to produce energy.</p>

    <p class = "p16">16/8 intermittent fasting is one of the most popular styles 
        of fasting. Proponents claim that it’s an easy, convenient 
        and sustainable way to lose weight and improve overall health.</p>


<p class = "p18">This type of fasting, which is the main topic of this article, 
        is similar to the 16:8 intermittent fasting, only the difference 
        is that your eating window is smaller, so you have to manage to 
        consume all your calories for 6 hours of your day. In that period, 
        you can have 2 full meals and a snack.</p>

<p class = "p20">The 20:4 fast is designed to reflect the eating patterns of ancient 
        warriors and timing is the key. It’s based on the idea that in primitive 
        times, people spent their days actively hunting and gathering before an 
        evening feast.</p>

<p class = "pOMAD">The One Meal A Day (OMAD) diet is an extreme version of time-restricted eating, 
        like intermittent fasting. However, unlike intermittent fasting which usually 
        allows a four or eight-hour eating window, the OMAD diet has a one-hour eating 
        window. So you fast for the other 23 hours of the day.</p>

                Intermittent fasting has helped me lose weight in record time,
                 stay more focused, achieve goals that I had never achieved before, 
                 and above all lower my anxiety levels. What else can I ask for? 
                 We literally get sick from eating too much, the body needs to heal 
                 and the only way to heal is by leaving it without food.
